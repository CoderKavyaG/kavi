# Mandela Effect : AI Causing Chaos

While randomly scrolling through the internet, I came across some hip-hop tracks, and one song caught my attention , it was a drop by Emiway Bantai called “Mat kar Lala.” The funny part is, that phrase never really came from him. What he actually said was “Mat kar beta.” Somewhere along the way, the internet flipped it, and the version everyone remembered became something that never existed.

That tiny realization made my mind spiral into the weirdest corner of the web: the Mandela Effect.

It’s when a large group of people remember the same event differently from how it actually happened. It got its name because many once believed Nelson Mandela died in prison in the 1980s, when in reality, he passed away in 2013. That small mismatch between memory and truth reveals how fragile our sense of reality can be.

At first, I brushed it off as one of those quirky internet things, maybe an editing mistake or some glitch on Wikipedia. But then, as I began noticing more examples, things I thought I knew for sure but turned out to be slightly off, it started getting unsettling. I kept thinking about how many of these are real and how many are just collective confusion built over time.

Then it hit me how deep this connection goes with technology, especially with the rise of AI.

## Where AI and Memory Collide

AI is now shaping how we see, read, and even remember things online. Every scroll, search, reel, and trend builds a version of the world for us, one that might not always be true, but definitely feels real. The scary part is how easily context can change now. What starts as a slight alteration in a video clip or a misquoted phrase can turn into a shared belief overnight.

With AI generating text, images, and voices almost indistinguishable from reality, it becomes hard to know what actually happened and what was simply created. When something looks that real, we automatically trust it. Over time, these small falsehoods pile up until they start shaping what everyone believes.

## When Algorithms Get Confused

As AI grows, the algorithms , the systems that decide what we see , begin to face their own confusion. When every piece of content looks equally authentic, recommendation systems can no longer cleanly distinguish genuine human data from synthetic patterns. The internet starts reflecting a distorted version of itself, repeating and amplifying what people believe instead of what’s true.

That’s how the Mandela Effect slips deeper into the digital age: when memory, truth, and technology blur into one endless scroll.

## A Fluid Reality

I discovered this today, purely by chance, and it made me think about how reality online is slowly becoming fluid. The same way people once misremembered Mandela’s death, we might end up misremembering digital history created by AI.

If the internet already had the power to twist memory, imagine what happens when machines that can rewrite context join the game. The difference between “real” and “almost real” may vanish before we even notice.

For now, I guess the only way to survive this chaos is to laugh when the internet messes with us. Because at this point, when someone asks whether Pikachu ever had a black spot at the end of his tail, maybe I’ll just say ,maybe someone time-traveled and changed the context.
